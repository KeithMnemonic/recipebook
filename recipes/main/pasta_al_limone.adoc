=== Simple pasta al limone

Ingredients:

* any pasta, fresh is better, home made is best
* garlic
* parsley
* lemon with an edible peel
* olive oil
* Parmigiano-Reggiano or any other hard Italian cheese of choice
* salt, pepper

Directions:

1. Slice the garlic, zest the lemon and press the juices out, cut the parsley
   and grate the cheese
2. Put a few glugs of olive oil into a pan and sweat/fry the garlic, lemon zest
   and freshly grated pepper in it.
3. Cook the pasta so that it is nearly done before the garlic starts turning
   brown (fresh pasta only takes a few minutes, home made one 60-120
   seconds). Once the pasta is ready, transfer it with prongs into the pan and
   add some pasta water as well.
4. Add the cheese, parsley and lemon juice, stir it well and optionally add a
   bit more pasta water for the sauce to emulsify.
5. Season to taste and serve *immediately*!
